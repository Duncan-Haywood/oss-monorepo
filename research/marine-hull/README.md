# Which body carries a survey payload furthest per kWh? Hull choice for small autonomous boats

**Status: open research programme (proposal stage), milestone 1 done.** A stdlib resistance and
range calculator for small displacement survey boats (`src/marine_hull/`, 9 tests) and a first
sweep: at equal displacement, a catamaran out-ranges a monohull in only **0.4% of 6,561 swept
cases and in none at equal length**, because friction (wetted area) sets drag at survey speed
below 1 m/s and hotel load fixes the best speed near 1 m/s. Preliminary: the wave-resistance term
is a placeholder, so this is a friction-limited comparison. See [`PROPOSAL.md`](PROPOSAL.md) and
[`LOG.md`](LOG.md).

## Method and reproduce

```bash
cd research/marine-hull
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m pytest tests -q          # 9 tests
PYTHONPATH=src python3 experiments/run.py > experiments/results.txt
```

`hull.py`: ITTC 1957 friction line (checked analytically: Cf = 0.003 at Re = 1e7), form factor,
wetted area S = c_s sqrt(V L), a placeholder wave term, propulsive and motor efficiency, hotel
load. Craft: 200 kg, 25% battery. Results: [`experiments/results.txt`](experiments/results.txt).

## Results (preliminary)

- Catamaran wins 27 of 6,561 cases; median range ratio cat/mono 0.85 (0.72 to 1.02).
- Monohull range 560 to 1,188 km (upper bound: no waves, current, turns, reserve); best speed about 1 m/s.

## Limitations

Seawater properties, efficiencies, form factors and wave term are unsourced or swept; no published
resistance curve has been reproduced yet (milestone 2); stability, deck area and payload are not
modelled. Simulation only: nothing here has been built or tested in water. Any real operation needs
the flag state's and local authority's rules (COLREGs, harbour master, permits).

## Next steps

Milestones 2 to 7 in the proposal. AI-assisted (Claude Code).
