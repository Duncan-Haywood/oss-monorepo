# When does rotor cant pay on a small quadrotor co-designed with its motors and controller?

Research programme `codesign-cant` (track 14, `codesign`; proposal: [`PROPOSAL.md`](PROPOSAL.md), log: [`LOG.md`](LOG.md)). It gathers seven earlier single-step projects on canted-rotor quadrotors (`codesign-aero-cant`, `-bound`, `-kappa`, `-propdata`, `-twr`, `-twrceil`, `-poshold`) into one question aimed at *IEEE RA-L*. Produced with AI assistance (Claude). **Simulated. The propeller torque ratio c comes from measured UIUC data; the mass, cost and motor fits, the plant ranges and the gust model are inherited assumptions.**

## Milestone 2: one thrust polytope for combined commands, and a price on hover power

**Question.** Milestone 1 let roll, pitch and yaw each saturate at their own limit at once, and left hover power free. Does cant still pay when the three torques share one thrust budget through a real mixer, and when power costs something?

**Headline (`experiments/m2_polytope/results.txt` and `restarts.txt`; simulated, 5 seeds, TWR 2).**

- **The shared polytope costs accuracy, and cant more than makes up for it.** With an attitude-priority mixer (roll and pitch first, yaw gets the rest, as PX4 and Betaflight do) held-out RMS error rises by 2.90° without cant and 1.63° with it (5 of 5 seeds each). Cant's paired advantage grows from 4.81° to **6.08°** (SD 0.28, 5 of 5). The tuned no-cant vehicle saturates roll and pitch on 97% of steps, leaving yaw nothing; with cant, yaw rides on the tangential thrust and is scaled on 39% of steps.
- **Pricing hover power shrinks the vehicle, not the cant.** At 0.3° per 100 W, hover power falls 4–7× (canted design 1380 W to 219–256 W) for at most 0.5° of extra error. The chosen cant stays at **28–37° in 9 of 10 seed-arms** from 0 to 1° per 100 W (best of three CMA-ES starts). The proposal's H1, a small 5–20° optimum, is refuted under this objective.
- **Cant still wins once power is priced:** −5.28 composite at 0.3° per 100 W (5 of 5) and −2.92 at 1° per 100 W (4 of 5).
- **Single-start CMA-ES is unreliable on the polytope.** One start per seed sent 2 of 5 seeds to 0–13° of cant at 0.3° per 100 W, with scores 4–6° worse; restarts recovered 32–37°. The no-cant landscape is multimodal too (restarts moved it 0.6° at 1° per 100 W).
- **Airmode helps** (collective free): −1.56° without cant (5 of 5), −0.26° with it (4 of 5).

## Milestone 1: the earlier actuator model, checked against a full allocation

**Question.** All seven earlier projects gave the simulator two hand-written torque limits. Are they right, and do the conclusions survive if they are not?

**Headline (numbers from `experiments/m1_allocation/results.txt`; simulated, 5 seeds).**

- **The formulas were wrong in three places.** The full 6×4 thrust-to-wrench map with every thrust in [0, Tmax], maximised by a linear programme (closed forms agree to 1e-15 on 300 random designs), gives yaw 4Δ(L sin α + κ cos α) and roll 4Δ(L cos α − κ sin α)/√2, where Δ = min(Th, Tmax − Th) with altitude held, or Tmax/2 if the mixer may give up altitude. The earlier yaw limit used 2 in place of 4 and the moment arm L/√2 in place of L, which understated yaw authority by 2× with no cant and up to 2.8× with cant. The earlier roll limit kept growing above TWR 2 by assuming negative rotor thrust. The side force per unit roll torque in `-poshold` was √2 too large.
- **Cant's advantage survives the correction.** Paired by seed, cant ≤ 35° beats no cant by 4.81° RMS (SD 0.12, 5 of 5 seeds) with corrected limits at TWR 2, against 4.62° with the old ones. With TWR free the gap is 4.81° (altitude held) or 2.77° (collective free), against 2.43° before.
- **The chosen cant does not move.** 35–37° at an 80° bound, the same plateau as before. That plateau comes from the objective: attitude error only, with cost as a $300 cap. The 35° design weighs 3.17 kg against 1.74 kg without cant and needs cos(35°)^−1.5 = 1.35× the ideal hover power. Naming a best cant angle needs an objective that prices energy.
- **The motor-headroom result does not survive.** `-twrceil`'s interior optimum near TWR 5 depended on the roll limit growing past TWR 2. With altitude held the optimiser picks TWR 2.0–2.3; with collective free it picks 3.3–4.7.
- The earlier numbers are reproduced exactly when the old limits are switched back on (13.65° and 11.22° for twrceil, 17.06° and 12.46° for propdata).

## Method

**Milestone 2.** `allocation.mix_priority` uses the fact that the roll, pitch, yaw and Fz rows of the canted-X wrench map are orthogonal sign patterns. It computes the thrust change for a request, then the largest scales for roll and pitch together and then for yaw that keep every thrust in [0, Tmax] (collective held at hover) or the thrust spread within Tmax (airmode). Tests check it against the vector-built `layout`, the thrust bounds and maximality. `aero.score(mixer=..., lam=...)` scores J = −RMS − λ·P_hover/100 W, with P_hover the sizing closure's electrical hover power. `experiments/m2_polytope/run.py` runs mixer {box, prio} × cant bound {0, 80°} × λ {0, 0.1, 0.3, 1}, plus airmode, with milestone 1's search (100 CMA-ES runs). `restarts.py` reruns the polytope arms at λ 0.3 and 1 with three starts per seed. Predictions for both were committed to `LOG.md` before each ran. Q1–Q3 and Q5–Q7 held; Q4 and H1 were refuted; the restart prediction R1 held for the angle but not for a 5-of-5 win, and R2 was refuted.

**Milestone 1.** 
`src/codesign_cant/allocation.py` builds the wrench map from vectors (rotor positions, canted thrust axes, spin-signed reaction torque). It solves the largest pure roll, pitch and yaw torque as a linear programme (`scipy.optimize.linprog`, HiGHS), with no net side force and the other torques at zero, and gives the closed forms the tests check against it. `src/codesign_cant/aero.py` is `codesign-aero-cant-twrceil`'s simulator, unchanged except for an `actuator` switch (`prior`, `hover`, `free`) that sets the two torque limits. `experiments/m1_allocation/run.py` reruns joint CMA-ES over arm length, propeller diameter, cant, optional TWR and six PID gains: 1920 evaluations, 5 seeds, 16 training and 64 held-out wide-plant episodes, $300 cap, κ = c·D with c = 0.081, the median of 77 measured UIUC propellers. The predictions in `LOG.md` were committed before the run. P1, P4 and P6 held; P2, P3 and P5 were refuted.

## Limitations

- Milestone 1's arms use a per-axis torque box. Milestone 2's polytope mixer has TWR fixed at 2, where a hover-held mixer has the least room. The power price λ is a modelling choice, swept from 0 to 1° per 100 W, not a measured mission value.
- Under the polytope mixer the search landscape is multimodal, so single-start results are unreliable. Three starts were used only for four arms.
- Attitude steps only, 2 s episodes, five seeds, one κ. The mass, cost and motor fits and the plant ranges are inherited assumptions, not catalogue data. No hardware.

## Next steps

Milestone 3: motor catalogue data replacing the inherited fits, with TWR free under the polytope mixer and multi-start search by default. After that: INDI and geometric attitude baselines, and a RotorPy check (`PROPOSAL.md`, "Milestones").

## Owner steps

Print canted motor mounts at 0° and about 32° for one frame. Then log yaw step response, and measure side force on a load cell while roll torque is commanded. Not done here.
