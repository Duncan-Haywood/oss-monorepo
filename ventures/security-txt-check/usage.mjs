// Records an anonymous, aggregate-only local usage count: the event name and
// the current day, kept in the visitor's own browser. It never stores the
// domain checked, the pasted security.txt, or anything about what was found.
// That matters more here than on most tools in this catalogue: a
// security.txt names a company's disclosure contact, and a list of which
// sites someone is checking is exactly the kind of thing that must not be
// transmitted anywhere. This tool never reads it off the visitor's machine
// either.

// Reading the `localStorage` global throws SecurityError when the visitor
// blocks site data (Chrome's "block all cookies", Safari with cookies
// blocked), and a default parameter is evaluated before any try in the body.
// So the defaults below, and the page's calls, go through this instead of
// naming the global: a blocked store reads as "no storage", never a crash.
