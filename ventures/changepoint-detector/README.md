# Changepoint Detector: find when a time series changed

A free, in-browser **changepoint detection** tool: paste or upload a time series
(sales, sign-ups, sensor readings, latency, prices) and see **when its level or
volatility changed**, with the exact best segmentation from **PELT** and a
probability for each change from **Bayesian online changepoint detection**.
Nothing is uploaded. Also a command-line tool and an engine AI agents can call.

**Live tool:** https://duncan-haywood.github.io/monorepo-projects/changepoint-detector/

After using this, you can say **whether a series really shifted, from which
date, by how much, and how sure the evidence is**, instead of eyeballing a chart.

Part of [research algorithms as free tools](../../portfolio/research-tools/README.md):
methods from published papers, run on your own data, with the papers cited.

## Methods and citations

- **PELT**: Killick, R., Fearnhead, P. & Eckley, I. A. (2012). Optimal
  detection of changepoints with a linear computational cost. *Journal of the
  American Statistical Association* 107(500), 1590-1598.
  doi:[10.1080/01621459.2012.737745](https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2012.737745).
  Exact minimum of Gaussian -2 log-likelihood plus a penalty per change, for a
  change in mean (noise sd estimated once from the median absolute difference
  of successive points) or in mean and variance (minimum segment 5 by default).
  Penalties: BIC (default; 2 log n for mean, 3 log n for mean and variance),
  AIC, Hannan-Quinn, or a number.
- **Bayesian online changepoint detection**: Adams, R. P. & MacKay, D. J. C.
  (2007). Bayesian online changepoint detection.
  [arXiv:0710.3742](https://arxiv.org/abs/0710.3742). Run-length recursion
  with a constant hazard and a Normal-Inverse-Gamma model (Student-t
  predictive), prior centred on the data's median and robust variance.
  Reported per point: the posterior probability, five points later, that a new
  segment began there (under a constant hazard, P(change at the newest point)
  always equals the hazard, so it carries no information on its own).

The engine exports both citations as `PAPERS`, with what was implemented and
where it departs from the paper.

## Use it

- **Browser:** open the live page, paste a CSV, or click the Nile example.
- **Command line** (Node 18+, no install):
  `node cli.mjs series.csv --column sales --model meanvar`, `--json` for
  machine-readable output, `--example` for the Nile data, `--help` for all options.
- **AI agents / MCP:** from a clone of the repository,
  `node platform/agents/tools.mjs call changepoint-detector analyze --input '{"values":[...]}'`
  or the `call_tool` tool of the repository's MCP server
  ([`platform/agents/`](../../platform/agents/README.md)).

## Verification

`node --test` (31 tests). What they check:

- **Against the literature:** on the Nile series (data/SOURCE.md) PELT puts
  the change at index 28, the first year of the new level being 1899: the
  same answer Cobb (1978) gives and R's `changepoint::cpt.mean(Nile,
  method = "PELT")` reports (`cpts = 28`). Output of `node cli.mjs --example`
  on 2026-10-20: segments 1871-1898 (mean 1097.75, sd 135.0) and 1899-1970
  (mean 849.97, sd 124.8); Bayesian probability 79% at 1899, the only point
  above 50%. The mean-and-variance model gives the same single change.
- **PELT is exact:** on 25 seeded random piecewise series, both models and
  three penalties, PELT's segmentation and cost equal brute-force optimal
  partitioning (no pruning).
- **BOCPD is exact:** with the hazard driven to zero, its log evidence equals
  the closed-form Normal-Inverse-Gamma marginal likelihood (to 1e-6).
- **Behaviour:** planted mean shifts are recovered within 2 points; a pure
  variance change is found by the mean-and-variance model; BIC splits at most
  3 of 30 pure-noise series of length 300; the robust noise estimate ignores a
  level shift; CSV parsing handles headers, named columns, quoted thousands,
  blank rows and semicolons.

Not verified: behaviour on strongly autocorrelated or seasonal series (both
methods assume independent noise within a segment, so such series show extra
changes).

## Limits

Steps, not trends: a gradual drift is approximated by several steps. Remove
known seasonality first. A changepoint describes the data, not its cause.
Up to 100,000 points; the Bayesian pass is the slow part on long series.

## What you use today, and what this does differently

- **R's `changepoint` / Python's `ruptures` packages:** the reference tools, and more complete; they
  need a programming environment. This runs the same class of method in a browser tab, from a CSV.
- **Eyeballing a chart:** fast, but cannot say whether a dip is noise or a shift, or how sure to be.
- **Anomaly alerts in a monitoring product:** flag single odd points, not a lasting change in level.
