# Chant Forge

Gregorian chant and traditional Catholic hymns, arranged for the gym: all-male
choir lines over deep house, EDM, hard rock and metal. This is a long-term
production project (owner, 2026-11-03: "very masculine stuff for the gym. all
male choirs. would be fun to make as a long term project. also being able to
publish to spotify etc."). The plan is in [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md).

The code is open source (MIT). The pipeline goes from public-domain chant to a
released track:

1. **Source:** chant in GABC (the notation Gregorio typesets), each piece
   transcribed from a cited public-domain edition ([`corpus/`](corpus/README.md)).
2. **Convert** (this slice): GABC to a MIDI choir line with Latin lyrics,
   transposed for men's voices and fitted to a grid.
3. **Arrange:** genre templates (drums, bass, synths, guitars) built around
   the line. Not built.
4. **Voice:** a real men's choir (recorded) or a singing synthesiser. Not built.
5. **Release:** loudness (done, `master-cli.mjs`), metadata, credits and AI-disclosure checks before a
   distributor upload (done: `node release-cli.mjs release.json`, 7 tests, 2026-11-03).

## What works now

```sh
node ventures/chant-forge/cli.mjs ventures/chant-forge/examples/dies-irae-incipit.gabc \
  --bpm 124 --fit 8 --final 50 --drone -o dies-irae.mid
```

```
Dies irae (first line only): 8 notes, C3-F3 (ambitus 5 semitones), final D3
mode 1
2.00 bars, 3.9 s at 124 BPM
wrote dies-irae.mid
```

- `gabc.mjs` reads the following:
  - c and f clefs on lines 1–4, plus the `cb` flat clef;
  - pitches `a`–`m`;
  - flats, naturals and sharps (`x y #`), which last to the end of the word or the next bar;
  - the punctum mora (`.`) and the episema (`_`);
  - custodes (`g+`), which are not sung;
  - the four bars `, ; : ::`.

  Neume shapes (virga, quilisma, liquescents and so on) are treated as plain
  notes. A note before any clef is assumed to be in c4, with a warning.
- `fitToBars` pads the rest after each full bar so the next phrase starts on a
  downbeat. Chant has no metre, and this is the simplest way to put it on a grid
  without changing any note's length.
- `summarize` reports range, ambitus and final. It also checks the final
  against the `mode:` header (modes 1–2 end on re, 3–4 on mi, 5–6 on fa, 7–8 on
  sol), which catches a transcription that is off by a step.
- `midi.mjs` writes a format-1 MIDI file with no dependencies:
  - a conductor track with tempo, 4/4 and the title;
  - the choir line (GM Choir Aahs) with one lyric event per syllable;
  - an optional drone on the final, an octave down (GM Church Organ).

Tests: `node --test ventures/chant-forge/chant-forge.test.mjs` (8 tests,
passing 2026-11-03). On 2026-11-03 the example's output was also read back with
an independent parser (Python `mido` 1.x): 3 tracks, 3.87 s, lyrics in order.

## Mix and master check

```sh
node ventures/chant-forge/master-cli.mjs track.wav   # exit 0 pass, 1 fail, 2 unreadable
```

`master.mjs` reads 16/24/32-bit PCM and float WAV (mono or stereo) and reports
BS.1770-4 integrated loudness (K-weighting, 400 ms blocks, -70 LUFS and -10 LU
gates), true peak (4x oversampled), mono-sum loss with L/R correlation, and runs
of full-scale samples. Targets: -14 LUFS +/- 1.5, true peak at most -1 dBTP,
mono loss at most 3 dB, no clipping. Checked 2026-11-03 against the standard's
calibration points (a 0 dBFS 997 Hz sine reads -3.01 LUFS mono, 0.0 stereo), a
fs/4 sine whose samples miss the peak by 3 dB, and phase-inverted and
over-driven files (6 tests). Checked 2026-11-03 against ffmpeg's `ebur128`
filter (`node eval/ffmpeg-check.mjs`; six synthetic stereo 48 kHz signals: three
sines, pink and white noise, a gated loud/quiet noise): integrated loudness
within 0.05 LU on all six, true peak within 0.33 dB (the worst case, white
noise, reads -13.47 here and -13.8 in ffmpeg; 16x oversampling gives -12.9, so
both 4x meters under-read and ours is the closer). Not checked against EBU test
files or a real mix; the true-peak filter is a windowed sinc, not the Annex 2
coefficients. Distributor targets change: read
theirs before release.

## Real Gregorio files (2026-11-03)

Fixed after reading the format, tested on made-up strings shaped like real files
(`real-files.test.mjs`, 6 tests), not yet run on a batch of GregoBase files:
CRLF line endings no longer defeat `%` comment stripping (a comment's text was
being sung as a lyric); `<sp>R/</sp>`, `<sp>V/</sp>` and `<sp>'ae</sp>` keep their
signs; `<v>` (raw TeX) and `<alt>` text, `{}` centre braces, `*` and the cross
are not lyrics; a clef change inside a group, as in `(::c3)` or `(z c3)`, now
moves the staff. NABC alternations are still cut at the first `|`.

## Not checked yet

- `examples/dies-irae-incipit.gabc` is the widely quoted opening motif
  (F E F D E C D D), typed from memory. It has not been transcribed from a scan.
  It is a demo input, not a corpus entry.
- The converter has run on the five corpus files and made-up inputs, not on a
  batch of real Gregorio files.
- Nothing has been arranged, sung, mixed or published.

## Rules this project keeps

- **Sources must be public domain and cited.** The melodies and Latin texts in
  the 1908 Vatican edition and other pre-1929 printings are public domain in the
  US. Modern editions, translations and recordings can still be under
  copyright. **Never sample an existing recording.**
- **Publishing needs the owner.** A distributor account (DistroKid or similar)
  needs the owner's card, name and choice of artist name. Agents prepare
  releases; they don't upload them.
- **Honest credits:**
  - say which parts are synthesised and use the distributor's AI-disclosure
    fields;
  - never imply a real monastery or choir sang it;
  - no bought streams or fake listener numbers.
- **Treat the texts with respect.** These are liturgical texts. Use them whole
  and in their sense, not as jokes.
