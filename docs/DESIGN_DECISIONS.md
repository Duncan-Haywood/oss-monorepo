# ShootFlow Design Decisions

ShootFlow is a personal tool and product concept for photographers and videographers who want more finished social content with less file-management and editing overhead. The first implementation layer is a conservative core engine that can be shared by a future Mac app, iPhone app, background agent, and cloud/GPU workers.

## Product shape

- Start as a desktop-first Mac workflow because large RAW/video shoots, SD cards, and external SSDs are easiest to manage locally.
- Add iPhone capture/review later as a companion: approve selects, review grades, post drafts, and kick off exports.
- Keep local storage and originals as the source of truth. AI may suggest, rank, grade, crop, and assemble, but the system should make provenance and reversibility obvious.
- Treat Instagram Reels, carousels, and feed photos as first-class deliverables, not as a final export checkbox.

## Safety invariants

- Never delete source media during ingest.
- Never overwrite an existing destination file with different bytes.
- Verify copies with SHA-256 before treating an import as complete.
- Write ingest manifests so later editing jobs can reference immutable originals and checksums.
- Reject symlink-based source or destination paths in the core importer. This is intentionally strict because camera-card imports are high-trust, high-value operations.
- Rank detected drives conservatively. Camera-card-like volumes are review-only sources; large writable SSDs can be automatic destination candidates.

## Core architecture

The repo currently contains a Python core package because it is quick to test and can model the critical workflow contracts before native UI work starts.

- `shootflow.ingest`: media discovery, import planning, checksum copy execution, and manifest writing.
- `shootflow.storage`: drive/storage candidate ranking for future Mac/iPhone device detection layers.
- `shootflow.deliverables`: parallelizable job planning for graded intermediates and Instagram outputs.

Future native applications should wrap these contracts rather than reimplementing the safety rules in UI code.

## AI/color pipeline direction

The desired high-quality pipeline is:

1. Ingest originals to a dated shoot folder.
2. Generate proxies and technical metadata in parallel.
3. Run content understanding: scene grouping, face/object/context tags, sharpness, exposure, motion, audio energy, and duplicate detection.
4. Build look references from user presets, past shoots, brand mood boards, or a hero frame.
5. Generate non-destructive color decisions per scene/set, not isolated per asset.
6. Export graded intermediates for all selects.
7. Assemble deliverables: reels, carousels, photo sets, story crops, thumbnails, captions, and suggested posting packages.
8. Iterate using reviewer feedback: "warmer skin," "more cinematic contrast," "use more behind-the-scenes," "make it faster."

High quality depends on scene-level consistency and reversible edits. The system should produce edit decision data first, then render from masters.

## Parallelism model

- Per-asset analysis and initial grading jobs are embarrassingly parallel.
- Scene clustering, look normalization, and deliverable assembly depend on per-asset outputs.
- Reels should assemble from proxy timelines, then conform from graded masters.
- The job graph should be deterministic and resumable so 10,000+ asset shoots can recover from interruption without starting over.

## Business viability notes

Primary buyers:

- Photographers and videographers who need more Instagram output but want time back from culling, editing, and file management.
- Small studios already paying editors who want faster turnaround, better consistency, and more content per dollar.
- Creators with large archives who want old footage turned into new reels and carousels.

Useful wedges:

- "Dump a card, get organized imports and draft IG packs."
- "Turn a wedding/editorial/event shoot into 3 reels, 2 carousels, and graded selects overnight."
- "Consistent look across photo and video without managing files by hand."

Avoid competing only on generic AI editing. The differentiator is end-to-end workflow: ingest safety, organization, grade consistency, social packaging, and iteration.

## Open decisions for future iterations

- Native stack: Swift/SwiftUI plus a Python/Rust worker, or a Tauri/Electron shell with native media extensions.
- Color engine: LUT/CDL/ACES-style decision layer, Core Image/Metal renderer, DaVinci Resolve integration, or hybrid.
- VLM providers: local model support for privacy vs. hosted APIs for quality and throughput.
- Sync model between Mac and iPhone.
- Pricing: one-time pro tool, subscription, or usage-based render credits.
