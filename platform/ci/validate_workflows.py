"""Validate that every .github/workflows file is a well-formed GitHub workflow.

Two invariants:

1. Parseability. An unparseable workflow file fails silently: GitHub registers
   it with its `name` set to its own path, then emits a zero-job
   `startup_failure` run (blank name, `path: "BuildFailed"`) for every event it
   would have matched. Nothing in the PR checks list turns red, so the file can
   sit broken for days while every push produces a failed run nobody can
   attribute to a workflow.

2. Least privilege. Every workflow must declare an explicit `permissions:`
   scope for GITHUB_TOKEN -- either top-level or on every job. A file with none
   runs with the repository's default token scope, broader than any
   checkout/build/lint/test step needs. Every workflow on `main` already pins a
   scope; this check keeps a newly-added one from silently regressing that.
