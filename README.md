# monorepo-projects

A single repository for the whole venture portfolio, plus the shared agent
platform that works on it.

The point of consolidating: agent automation is repo-scoped. In a polyrepo
setup every new venture costs a fresh onboarding pass across every agent
surface (Claude Code, Cursor, Antigravity, CI). Here a new venture is a new
directory that inherits the platform automatically.

## Layout

```
ventures/     one directory per business; each has a VENTURE.yaml
platform/     shared agent definitions, skills, and CI — versioned once
portfolio/    the ledger and the router that allocates agent effort
```

## Security

Repository-wide scans run in Gitea Actions on pull requests, `main`, and a
weekly schedule. See the [security policy](SECURITY.md),
[operations guide](docs/security/README.md),
[remediation log](docs/security/REMEDIATION_LOG.md), and
[roadmap](docs/security/ROADMAP.md). Report vulnerabilities privately, never
in a public issue.

### ventures/

Each venture is self-contained and carries a `VENTURE.yaml` at its root. That
file is the interface between "this business exists" and "the router knows
about it" — adding a venture means adding that file; nothing else needs to
change.

Venture directories are kept cleanly bounded so a venture can be extracted
with `git filter-repo` if it is ever sold or spun off.

### platform/

The processes that are the same across ventures: agent definitions, skills,
reusable CI. If a procedure is being copy-pasted between ventures, it belongs
here instead.

### portfolio/

`ledger/` records revenue, cost, agent-hours, and outcomes per venture.
`router/` reads the ledger plus each `VENTURE.yaml` and decides where agent
effort goes next. See [portfolio/router/README.md](portfolio/router/README.md)
for how allocation works and why it is not a pure ROI maximizer.

## History

Ventures were merged in with `git subtree`, so each one's full commit history
is preserved and attributed. The original standalone repositories still exist
and were not deleted.
