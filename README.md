# ShootFlow

ShootFlow is an early-stage personal tool and product concept for photographers
and videographers who want high-quality Instagram reels, carousels, and graded
intermediates without spending their lives on file wrangling.

The product direction is:

- ingest SD cards, local folders, SSDs, RAW/JPEG/log/video footage safely;
- never delete source media during ingest;
- copy with checksums, manifests, and conflict detection;
- build highly parallelizable color-grading and deliverable jobs;
- produce cinematic reels, carousels, feed photo sets, and intermediate graded
  masters for human review or editor handoff.

## Current repository state

This repo currently contains the first testable core utilities:

- `shootflow.ingest` plans and executes safe media copies.
- `shootflow.catalog` loads ingest manifests into a photo/video catalog for
  downstream production planning.
- `shootflow.analysis` loads per-asset VLM JSON outputs only when they match a
  trusted production plan, then binds them to graded artifact paths for story
  selection.
- `shootflow.assembly` consumes trusted storyline selections and produces
  explicit render tasks from verified graded assets, without performing media
  rendering or destructive file operations. It can persist those tasks to a
  strict `deliverables/render_tasks.json` manifest for future render workers,
  including chunked photo-set export tasks for high-volume shoots.
- `shootflow.render_status` persists a strict `deliverables/render_status.json`
  manifest keyed by trusted render task IDs so workers can resume, retry, and
  report progress without adding source-media paths or delete instructions.
  Status files are bound to a render-plan fingerprint so stale progress cannot
  be reused after storyline selections or render inputs change. Manifest-level
  compare/write helpers take a local advisory lock, update exactly one task
  status, and check the expected prior state, attempt, and optional timestamp
  lease token. A matching initialization helper can create the first all-pending
  status manifest from trusted render tasks, while refusing to reset existing
  progress or overwrite stale/mismatched status files.
- `shootflow.render_worker` turns trusted render tasks plus trusted status into
  dry-run worker actions. It schedules only dependency-ready pending/retryable
  tasks, reports blocked tasks, skips running/succeeded/failed tasks, claims
  ready work as running, and reports success/retry/failure statuses with
  checksums for declared deliverable outputs only. It can also plan explicit
  stale-running lease expirations as retryable status transitions and persist
  those expirations through the same compare/write boundary without granting
  cleanup or deletion authority.
- `shootflow.render_adapter` adds the first renderer-adapter boundary: a
  deterministic dry-run adapter that claims one trusted worker action, writes
  only its declared `deliverables/` outputs through non-overwriting placeholder
  files, reports checksums, and persists both claim and result through the
  single-task compare/write status path. It can also execute a trusted dry-run
  action plan in batches, running parallel-safe ready actions up to a caller
  supplied concurrency limit while preserving serial-only actions and leaving
  blocked tasks untouched for UI/scheduler visibility.
- `shootflow.render_scheduler` ties the dry-run render pieces into an iterative
  local orchestration loop: it reloads trusted status each pass, optionally
  persists stale lease expirations, plans dependency-ready actions, runs bounded
  dry-run batches, avoids hammering retryable tasks within the same run, and
  returns a compact completion/blocked/retryable/failed summary for a future Mac app.
  It can also persist `deliverables/render_scheduler_report.json`, a strict
  UI/agent handoff that records completed, retryable, failed, blocked,
  review-required, materialized-output, lease-conflict, and failure-message
  details without granting any new file authority.
- `shootflow.cli` exposes the first background-agent commands:
  `python -m shootflow.cli init-render-status` and
  `python -m shootflow.cli dry-run-render-scheduler`. The init command loads the
  strict persisted render-task manifest, creates the companion render-status
  manifest only when missing, and never resets existing matching progress. The
  scheduler command then runs the dry-run scheduler against the matching
  render-status manifest, writes the scheduler report, and can print that report
  as JSON for a Mac app or automation runner.
- `shootflow.demo_workspace` can create a tiny persisted CLI smoke workspace for
  demos and native-shell testing. It writes deterministic placeholder graded
  inputs plus `deliverables/render_tasks.json`, refuses to overwrite existing
  different files, and leaves render-status/report creation to the normal CLI
  commands so existing progress is not reset.
- `shootflow.storage` ranks possible source and destination drives
  conservatively, then can recommend a review-required import route from a
  likely camera card/source to a writable SSD/local destination without granting
  deletion or blind-import authority. It also includes an optional
  capacity-gated recommendation path for high-volume shoots so estimated import
  size plus safety headroom can block risky destination choices.
- `shootflow.storage_discovery` is the first native-app-facing discovery
  bridge: it scans reviewed mounted-volume roots such as macOS `/Volumes`,
  skips symlinks/files/inaccessible entries, turns immediate volume directories
  into `StorageCandidate` records, and can feed the same capacity-gated route
  recommendation contract. Native macOS/iPhone shell layers can now pass
  reviewed `VolumeDiscoveryHint` metadata for discovered volume paths so the
  portable core can distinguish internal disks, removable cards, read-only
  volumes, and external SSDs without broadening file authority.
- `shootflow.deliverables` builds initial Instagram deliverable job plans.
- `shootflow.story` turns VLM analysis scores into ranked first-cut reel,
  carousel, photo-set, and named reel-variant recommendations, then persists
  the selections as a deterministic `analysis/instagram_storylines.json`
  edit-decision artifact.
- `shootflow.production` expands a shoot into deterministic proxy, VLM
  analysis, look-development, grading, storyline selection, and Instagram
  packaging waves.
- `shootflow.production_report` turns a verified `ingest_manifest.json` into a
  compact read-only production-wave report, giving a Mac app or launch agent the
  next safe screen after card offload without creating analysis, graded, or
  render files.
- `shootflow.card_workflow` ties mounted-volume route discovery, source-size
  estimation, checksum ingest preview, optional confirmed copy, and read-only
  production reporting into one product-facing card-dump workflow for Mac app
  shells and GTM demos.

The intended first workflow is:

1. Discover mounted-volume candidates from reviewed roots such as `/Volumes`,
   then rank attached cards, folders, and SSDs and present a reviewed
   source-to-destination import route with explicit no-delete/checksum notes.
   Native volume metadata, when available, should be passed in as advisory
   discovery hints rather than replacing the checksum ingest boundary.
2. Plan and execute a safe import from the approved card, folder, or SSD.
3. Keep the generated `ingest_manifest.json` as the boundary between file
   management and AI/editing work.
4. Load the manifest with `shootflow.catalog`, which rechecks manifest
   location, destination paths, file sizes, and checksums before production.
5. Summarize the manifest-backed production plan with `plan-production` so a Mac
   UI can show asset counts, parallel waves, and planned IG deliverables before
   starting AI/color work.
6. Build production waves from manifest-backed photo/video assets so proxies,
   VLM analysis, color decisions, graded masters, storyline choices, and
   Instagram packages all trace back to verified originals.
7. Load VLM results with `shootflow.analysis` so social planning consumes graded
   artifact paths and rejects analysis that does not match the planned source
   assets.
8. Persist `shootflow.story` selections as a trusted storyline artifact for
   downstream reel, reel-variant, carousel, and photo-set assemblers.
9. Build `shootflow.assembly` render tasks that verify selected graded files
   exist, keep raw originals out of social assembly inputs, and write
   deterministic `deliverables/` targets for future renderers. Large ranked
   photo sets are split into resumable chunks while preserving stable public
   output names like `photo_00001.jpg`; named reel variants render under
   `deliverables/instagram_reels/` without replacing the default reel handoff.
10. Persist and reload `deliverables/render_tasks.json` against the trusted
   assembly plan so parallel render workers cannot consume model-authored or
   stale task JSON.
11. Initialize, persist, and reload `deliverables/render_status.json` against the
   same trusted render tasks so a Mac app, local renderer, or cloud worker can
   show pending, running, succeeded, failed, and retryable work safely without
   resetting prior progress.
12. Derive renderer-neutral worker actions from the trusted task/status pair
    before any ffmpeg/Core Image/DaVinci/cloud adapter opens media files.
13. Use worker status-transition helpers to claim ready work, reject stale
    attempts, and report completed outputs by checksum before persisting updated
    render status manifests through a single-task compare/write update.
14. Let the scheduler plan stale running leases from the trusted status
    manifest when a caller supplies an explicit cutoff, then persist each
    retryable transition through the same compare/write boundary with the
    observed `running_since` value as `expected_updated_at`, reporting
    same-attempt heartbeat refreshes as conflicts instead of clobbering them.
15. Exercise adapter orchestration with the dry-run renderer before introducing
    ffmpeg, Core Image/Metal, DaVinci Resolve, or cloud GPU backends. The
    adapter consumes only worker actions, refuses symlinked or different
    existing outputs, and never deletes source, graded, or deliverable files.
16. Use the dry-run batch scheduler to execute dependency-ready actions at a
    bounded local concurrency level, record stale-action failures without
    materializing outputs, and keep blocked/running/failed work visible for
    later retries or review.
17. Use the iterative dry-run scheduler to alternate trusted status reloads,
    guarded stale-lease expiration, ready-action planning, and bounded batch
    execution until the current render plan is complete, blocked, failed,
    waiting, or has retryable work that should not be hammered again without review.
18. Persist `deliverables/render_scheduler_report.json` against the trusted
    assembly plan and final render status so a Mac app, background agent, or next
    automation run can show what finished and what needs review without parsing
    worker internals.
19. Run the same handoff through
    `python -m shootflow.cli init-render-status` followed by
    `python -m shootflow.cli dry-run-render-scheduler` when a UI/background-agent
    process starts from persisted manifests instead of an in-memory production
    plan.
20. Use `python -m shootflow.cli card-dump-workflow` as the first complete
    native-shell handoff from detected volumes to previewed ingest, and only
    with `--confirm-ingest`, verified copy plus a read-only production summary.
21. Use `shootflow.demo_workspace.create_persisted_cli_demo_workspace(...)` to
    build a safe, repeatable persisted-manifest smoke workspace for Mac UI shells,
    GTM demos, and continuation agents without touching source media or resetting
    render progress.

The current persisted-manifest CLI flow is:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m shootflow.cli init-render-status --workspace <dir>
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m shootflow.cli dry-run-render-scheduler --workspace <dir> \
  --completed-dependency rank_instagram_storylines \
  --renderer dry-run-local \
  --started-at 2026-05-07T16:00:00Z \
  --completed-at 2026-05-07T16:00:05Z \
  --generated-at 2026-05-07T16:00:06Z
```

The init command writes only metadata under `deliverables/`, never deletes media,
and fails rather than overwriting an existing status manifest that no longer
matches the trusted render-task plan.

The import-route planning flow is:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m shootflow.cli plan-import-route \
  --volume-root /Volumes \
  --estimate-source-bytes \
  --headroom-bytes 34359738368 \
  --print-candidates
```

This command performs mounted-volume discovery and emits a review-required JSON
recommendation for source/destination routing. It can estimate media bytes from
the discovered source and apply a destination capacity gate before ingest.
It does not copy files, delete source media, or grant destructive authority.

The unified card-dump workflow for a Mac app shell or demo is:

```bash
# Preview detected route + checksum copy plan. No bytes are copied.
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m shootflow.cli card-dump-workflow \
  --volume-root /Volumes \
  --shoot-date 2026-05-08 \
  --shoot-slug desert-editorial \
  --destination-subfolder ShootFlow

# Execute the same reviewed route and then print the read-only production summary.
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m shootflow.cli card-dump-workflow \
  --volume-root /Volumes \
  --shoot-date 2026-05-08 \
  --shoot-slug desert-editorial \
  --destination-subfolder ShootFlow \
  --confirm-ingest
```

Without `--confirm-ingest`, this command only discovers, estimates, and previews
the copy plan. With `--confirm-ingest`, it still never deletes source media,
never overwrites different destination bytes, verifies every copied item by
SHA-256, writes `ingest_manifest.json`, and then runs read-only production
planning from that manifest.

The safe ingest CLI flow (after operator review of the planned route) is:

```bash
# 1) Preview which media files would be copied. Computes SHA-256 checksums but
#    never copies bytes and never writes a manifest.
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m shootflow.cli preview-ingest \
  --source /Volumes/EOS_DIGITAL \
  --destination /Volumes/Samsung_T7/ShootFlow \
  --shoot-date 2026-05-08 \
  --shoot-slug desert-editorial

# 2) Execute the safe checksum-verified copy. Without --confirm the command
#    refuses to run; with --confirm it copies through temporary files, verifies
#    each destination's SHA-256, and writes ingest_manifest.json in the shoot folder.
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m shootflow.cli execute-ingest \
  --source /Volumes/EOS_DIGITAL \
  --destination /Volumes/Samsung_T7/ShootFlow \
  --shoot-date 2026-05-08 \
  --shoot-slug desert-editorial \
  --confirm
```

The ingest CLI never deletes source media, never overwrites destination files
with different bytes, rejects symlinked source/destination paths, and writes
the manifest only after every copy passes its SHA-256 check. `execute-ingest`
requires explicit `--confirm` so background-agent automation cannot trigger a
copy by accident.

After ingest, the read-only production-plan report is:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m shootflow.cli plan-production \
  --ingest-manifest /Volumes/Samsung_T7/ShootFlow/2026-05-08_desert-editorial/ingest_manifest.json
```

This reloads and revalidates the manifest, skips non-photo/video files for
production, summarizes asset counts, parallel production waves, and planned IG
deliverables, and writes no analysis, graded, render-task, status, or
deliverable files.
