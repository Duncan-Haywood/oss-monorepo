/**
 * blockers.ts — the single source of truth for what's blocking the
 * business on a human action right now.
 *
 * Why this exists: by 2026-07-13, roughly two dozen agent sessions in a
 * row had found every agent-doable roadmap task already `done` and spent
 * part of their session re-describing the same ~5 human-blocked items —
 * once in README.md prose, again in a fresh progress-log.ts paragraph,
 * sometimes a third time in roadmap.ts `blockedReason` fields. Three
 * independent hand-written copies of the same facts drift apart quietly
 * (nobody notices until they disagree), and progress-log.ts grew large
 * without adding new information.
 *
 * The fix: one typed list, one entry per real blocker. A session that
 * checks and finds nothing changed bumps `lastConfirmed` and
 * `confirmedByCount` right here — a one-line diff — instead of writing a
 * new progress-log.ts paragraph. A session only owes progress-log.ts (and
 * roadmap.ts, decisions-log.ts) a new entry when it actually changes
 * something: ships an artifact, flips a task's status, makes a real
 * decision, resolves a blocker, or edits this list itself.
 *
 * roadmap.ts's per-task `blockedReason` still exists and should stay
 * accurate, but treat *this* file as the canonical, at-a-glance list —
 * README.md and prompt_process.tsx both read from it instead of
 * maintaining their own prose copy.
